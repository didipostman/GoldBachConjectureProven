Goldbach's conjecture is one of the oldest and best-known unsolved problems in number theory and all of mathematics. It states that every even natural number greater than 2 is the sum of two prime numbers.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A prime number must be an odd number
The sum of 2 odd numbers is an even number
Then
The sum of two prime numbers is an even number (A).
Erdös Theorem : For every integer n > 1, it exists always a prime number between n and 2n
(Source : Le Beau livre des Maths De Pythagore à la 57 dimension DUNOD edition, author Clifford A.Pickover)
By récurrence of Erdös Theorem mentioned above and (A)
There is always k integer which is the sum of two prime numbers p and q. (B)

We can state then every even natural number greater than 2 is the sum of 2 prime numbers 
(what needed to be demonstrated) Goldbach’s conjecture proven.
